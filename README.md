# Advent of Code - 2023

This repo contains all my submissions for Advent of Code 2023.

All done in Java with JDK 21.

Since you can't distribute your inputs according to the Advent of Code ToS, my inputs are stored in an encrypted form with AES that only I can decrypt, so it's for my own convenience to run the benchmark on a few different computers I have.
